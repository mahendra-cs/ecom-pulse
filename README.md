# Ecom-Pulse: Microservice Simulation for AI-Driven Issue Detection

Ecom-Pulse is a simulated e-commerce microservice application designed to generate realistic metrics and logs. This project serves as a practical environment for demonstrating an AI-powered issue detection system across distributed microservices.

## Project Overview

Ecom-Pulse mimics a basic e-commerce workflow, involving order creation, inventory management, and payment processing. Each core function is handled by a dedicated microservice, allowing for independent development, deployment, and scaling. The services are instrumented to expose Prometheus metrics, enabling comprehensive monitoring and data collection for AI analysis.

## Microservices

### 1. Order Service (`order-service`)
-   **Description:** Handles the creation and processing of customer orders.
-   **Port:** `8080`
-   **Key Functionality:** Receives order requests, interacts with the Inventory and Payment services to fulfill orders.

### 2. Inventory Service (`inventory-service`)
-   **Description:** Manages product stock and reserves items for orders.
-   **Port:** `8081`
-   **Key Functionality:** Reserves inventory based on order requests.

### 3. Payment Service (`payment-service`)
-   **Description:** Processes payments for orders.
-   **Port:** `8082`
-   **Key Functionality:** Simulates payment gateway interactions.

## Testing with JMeter

The project includes a JMeter test plan (`jmeter/create_order.jmx`) to simulate user traffic and generate requests to the microservices. This helps in creating a dynamic environment for collecting performance metrics and logs.

## Monitoring with Prometheus

Prometheus is configured to scrape metrics from all microservices. These metrics provide real-time insights into the health and performance of each service, forming the basis for AI-driven anomaly detection.

-   **Prometheus Dashboard:** Accessible at `http://localhost:9090`

## Visualization with Grafana

Grafana is integrated to visualize the metrics collected by Prometheus. It provides dashboards for monitoring service performance, identifying trends, and pinpointing potential issues.

-   **Grafana Dashboard:** Accessible at `http://localhost:3000`
    -   **Default Credentials:** `admin`/`admin` (you will be prompted to change the password on first login)

## How to Run the Project

To get Ecom-Pulse up and running, ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mahendra-cs/ecom-pulse.git
    cd ecom-pulse
    ```
2.  **Build and start the services:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```
    This command will:
    -   Build Docker images for all microservices.
    -   Start the Order, Inventory, and Payment services.
    -   Start Prometheus for metrics collection.
    -   Start Grafana for metrics visualization.
    -   Start JMeter for traffic simulation.

3.  **Access Dashboards:**
    -   Prometheus: `http://localhost:9090`
    -   Grafana: `http://localhost:3000`

## AI Project Integration

This Ecom-Pulse project is specifically designed to be used by your AI project. The AI project can:

-   **Consume Metrics:** Connect to Prometheus to collect real-time performance metrics (e.g., request rates, error rates, latency) from each microservice.
-   **Analyze Logs:** Process logs generated by the microservices to identify patterns, anomalies, and potential issues.
-   **Demonstrate Issue Detection:** Utilize the collected metrics and logs to showcase its ability to detect and diagnose issues across different microservices within a simulated e-commerce environment.

By providing a dynamic and instrumented microservice landscape, Ecom-Pulse offers a robust platform for developing and validating AI-driven solutions for operational intelligence and anomaly detection in distributed systems.
